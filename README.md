This is based on the kindle highlights python script found here 
[my-personal-zen/highlight_parser.py at master Â·
duarteocarmo/my-personal-zen](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/my-personal-zen/blob/master/highlight_parser.py)
# 
I adapted it to generate markdown. Duarte's script generates txt files and I
wanted markdown. 

You can use this script exactly like Duarte's script. He has written a blog
about it.
